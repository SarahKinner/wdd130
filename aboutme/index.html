    <h2>Sarah Kinner</h2>
    <p>Hi everyone! My name is Sarah Kinner and I was born in the Phillipines but I'm living in Virginia! I live with my mother who is a librarian for an elementary school and my two brothers where one of them are in middle school while the other one is in high school!</p>
    <p>I've always wanted to do coding since it's my dream is to one day make games to enertain people and put a smile on their face. That's why during my free time I like to make up stories along with drawing to enertain myself.</p>
    <p>I'm taking class since I want to learn all types of code and I also want to know how a website comes all together with coding!</p>
    <p>Can't wait to learn from this class!</p>
