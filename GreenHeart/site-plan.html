        Job of a Lifetime:

 

Tom has recently moved in and while looking for a job he ended up in front of a restaurant which for some reason he felt like he had to work there. But once he starts working there he learns through his coworkers that something bad happened right before he started working there along with encountering someone that is supposedly behind it all. Everyone working in the restaurant more or less doesn’t trust each other due to the incident that happened there but they are all trying to convince Tom to be on their side and help them even if it affects everyone else that works there. Who will Tom choose to work with and will he make that place better or for worse after it is all said and done? 

 

Bearing Hope: 

 

Claire is a student in college and in their free time they work on a personal game featuring a character of theirs that they have created a long time ago. But for a while now they have been dealing with internal problems and are having a hard time dealing with it. One day however when running and testing their code the character inside the game seems to be more lively and attentive than usual. Claire is first confused but soon learns there is more to the character that meets the eye. Would this character be the solution to all their problems or would it be just one more problem for Claire to deal with?

      <h3>Character Info</h3>
      <p>
        Tom: 

 

Tom is 22 years old and just started working at a restaurant where his co-workers and boss are more interesting to deal with than anything but there’s two people to that exception. He also just recently moved into a house and in between shifts at his workplace Tom likes to relax by playing video games before he has to go to work again. Recently Tom has taken interest in a photo album he didn’t know he had until after he moved in since inside it are photos of himself when he was a child that he doesn’t really remember but he looks at it constantly to see if he can remember anything from it. He personally loves snacking on any blue raspberry flavor candy whenever he has the chance to do so. He is always seen wearing his blue hat since it was given to his dad when he was a teenager and ever since then he rarely takes it off unless he is about to go to sleep. He hopes that one day he can make something for himself but for now he’s working in a restaurant and dealing with the craziness that comes with the job. 

 

Claire: 

 

Claire is 18 years old and currently works at a coffee shop where they have to deal with some interesting customers along with going to university. They still lived at home with their mother and their brother but their relationship is strained with both of them due to some actions they’ve done that Claire can’t forgive but has to tolerate since they don’t have enough money to rent out an apartment yet. While outside Claire puts out a cheerful and playful personality while at home they’re constantly tired and just wants to be left alone in their room. Claire’s dream is to one day make it as a game developer ever since they played some games made by their creators Matt and Ruby. So during their free time however they work on a personal game called “Forest Friends” where the player helps a character out that lives in the woods. No matter what happens in the day whether good or bad, at the end of the day Claire works on their game hoping it’ll make it big when published.
