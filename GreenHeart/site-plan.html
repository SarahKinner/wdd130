      <h3>Home page</h3>
      <p>
        The home page is to make the people that come to visit the site get a preview of what the website is all about. From the home page they will soon learn to know that this is basically a website for me to personally store some of stories along with adding character information that are in the stories that the viewers can read more about if they want to. The homepage will also be a glimpse to the viewers of my art that goes with the stories that I make. The images that are going to be put on that page are going to be a character that looks like me or in other words a Sona, so it shows it is a personal website to me and not some type of corporate or business website. Also, this website is to invite them to come read the stories I made along with the information about the characters that are involved in the stories because the website is really mostly for entertainment for myself just being able to put my stories and the character info  and the viewers that come into the website and are willing to read whatever I have put up on my website.

      <h3>Story Description</h3>
      <p>
        This page is for people to get a quick glimpse of the stories that I make since my stories can be a bit complicated but through the website it’ll make it easier for people to understand what the story is about through reading it. They’re not going to get the full story since the stories I have made are pretty long, but the visitors are just going to get a short description of what the story is basically about so it hooks the visitors in it while not boring them for being too long while it also gives me the chance to put in multiple of my stories. Also, the images that I am going to put there in the page is going to represent the story where the image is going to represent some lore from the story that will not be mentioned at all so the audience can make some theories about what some parts of the image I created mean with the help of the story descriptions to bring it all together. The images are going to show off some characters that are also in the story, but their names won’t be mentioned in the story description at all unlike the main character of the story since I want to make the readers curious along question how the characters play a role in the story.

      <h3>Character Info</h3>
      <p>
        This page is for people to get some info on some characters that are in the stories that are mentioned on the website. If people want to learn more about the characters that are in the story, they can look at this page since some info about the characters will never be mentioned in the actual stories. Information about the characters can range from basic information like their age and favorite color to random fun facts like what their favorite song is or some random memory that they look back to for absolutely no reason, but they do anyways because they can. The images put up on that page will have a full body image of the character being mentioned itself along with some random doodles that may or may not be related to the information I have put since I want the drawings to show that the character has some personality and not some character that just exists for when the situation is called for. This is also just a way for me to add any information of my characters that are in the story since I have made up a bunch of random info of my characters over the years and I it will be fun to finally share it to the visitors of my website for those who are interested in it.
