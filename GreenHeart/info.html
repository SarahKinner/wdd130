        <h3>Tom</h3>
        <p>Tom is 22 years old and just started working at a restaurant where his co-workers and boss are more interesting to deal with than anything but there’s two people to that exception. He also just recently moved into a house and in between shifts at his workplace Tom likes to relax by playing video games before he has to go to work again. Recently Tom has taken interest in a photo album he didn’t know he had until after he moved in since inside it are photos of himself when he was a child that he doesn’t really remember but he looks at it constantly to see if he can remember anything from it. He personally loves snacking on any blue raspberry flavor candy whenever he has the chance to do so. He is always seen wearing his blue hat since it was given to his dad when he was a teenager and ever since then he rarely takes it off unless he is about to go to sleep. He hopes that one day he can make something for himself but for now he’s working in a restaurant and dealing with the craziness that comes with the job.</p>

        <h3>Claire</h3>
        <p>Claire is 18 years old and currently works at a coffee shop where they have to deal with some interesting customers along with going to university. They still lived at home with their mother and their brother but their relationship is strained with both of them due to some actions they’ve done that Claire can’t forgive but has to tolerate since they don’t have enough money to rent out an apartment yet. While outside Claire puts out a cheerful and playful personality while at home they’re constantly tired and just wants to be left alone in their room. Claire’s dream is to one day make it as a game developer ever since they played some games made by their creators Matt and Ruby. So during their free time however they work on a personal game called “Forest Friends” where the player helps a character out that lives in the woods. No matter what happens in the day whether good or bad, at the end of the day Claire works on their game hoping it’ll make it big when published.</p>
